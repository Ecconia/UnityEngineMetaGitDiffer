# List of ideas and further enhancements to be made:

- Fold folders with only one child into single line.
- Confirm that the meta-referenced file exists and perceived the same mutation.
- Take Gits file similarity into account? How to use it?
- Somehow collapse folders where every child perceived the same mutation.
- Ability to interactively traverse the Git history.
